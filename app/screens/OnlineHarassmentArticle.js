        The Scope of Online Harassment (A snapshot):
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>
        In 2021, the Pew Research Center released a comprehensive report
        revealing that 41% of Americans have personally experienced some form of
        online harassment. Among these individuals, 25% reported being subjected
        to more severe forms, such as physical threats, stalking, or sustained
        harassment. While these numbers paint a disturbing picture of the
        digital environment, they also only scratch the surface of what many
        experience. Online harassment is not limited to overt threats and
        attacks. The data also shows that many users endure quieter, prolonged
        harassment that can be equally devastating...

        The Psychological Impact: Harassment's Lasting Effects:
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>
        The emotional toll of online harassment is staggering. According to the
        same Pew Research Center study, 53% of harassment victims report feeling
        stressed or anxious as a direct result of their experiences. Another 37%
        report feelings of sadness or depression. These numbers are even higher
        for individuals who endure long-term or severe forms of abuse, such as
        stalking or doxxing.

        People with many mass media appearances were targets of all types of

        Bitter Silence Allows Sexual Harassment to Continue in the Workplace:
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.text}>
        Sexual harassment in the workplace is continuing. However, the rate of
        sexual harassment disclosure is low, which causes many problems. Family
        barriers also play a role, as nurses in this study reported they were
        silent on sexual harassment due to fear of family blame or distrust of
        others...

      <Text style={styles.text}>
        Some nurses in the study remained silent on sexual harassment because
        they did not trust others. They were afraid that talking about this
        incident, even with close friends, would make the situation worse. "I no
        longer trusted anyone because I was afraid that my close friend would
        tell everyone about what had happened."
